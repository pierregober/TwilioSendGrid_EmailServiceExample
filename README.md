# TwilioSendGrid_EmailServiceExample

Here includes an example of me using SendGrid's Email API. 
I utilized this service to create the email service for a web application I created for the City of Angeles and 
I figured I'd share the wealth of knowledge.

In the following files, it includes methods to:
  -Attach a PDF or file
  -Confirmation Email Service
  -Reset Password Service
  -Single Email to Single Recipient
  -Single Email to Many Recipient
  -Salt and Hashing Passwords
